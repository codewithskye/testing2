                    üí° <strong>Project Overview:</strong> NeuroMech is a robotics company at the forefront of human-AI collaboration. This landing page was developed to showcase the product‚Äôs futuristic vision using an interactive 3D robot powered by Spline.

                <p class="project-description">
                    ‚ùå <strong>Problem:</strong> Most robotics or AI websites either rely too heavily on technical jargon or fail to visually capture the innovation behind the tech. Users are left uninspired or overwhelmed, resulting in low engagement or bounce.

                <p class="project-description">
                    üéØ <strong>Goal:</strong> Design a captivating, responsive landing page that introduces NeuroMech as a future-first robotics company. The goal was to combine immersive 3D elements with clear messaging and intuitive navigation.
                </p>
            
                <p class="project-description">
                    ‚úÖ <strong>Solution:</strong> A full-screen hero section featuring an animated 3D robot using <strong>Spline</strong> draws users in immediately. Paired with bold typography, hover animations, and a sleek hamburger menu, the design offers both functionality and visual flair. The layout was structured for clarity, with CTAs like "See How It Works" and "Try the Demo" guiding user interaction.

                    ‚ùå <strong>Problem:</strong> Many airdrop websites lack trust signals, engaging design, or a clear explanation of how the process works. This often leads to user confusion, drop-offs, and poor conversion rates during critical token launches.
